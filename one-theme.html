We wanted  to overhaul the product's look and feel as well as improve the user experience with better visibility and a more intuitive workflow. The new theme would automatically customize itself based on the user's role. This library would be centrally managed, available for reuse by all teams, and input would be encouraged by stakeholders and developers alike.</p></div>

  <div class="col-md-8 themed-grid-col"> <p>How could the full UI be refactored to meet the year end goals? Could we provide UX assets that could be utilized amongst several Agile teams? The refactor would need to happen in phases. How many? If short handed, could this design system be incorporated by other scrum teams within the company without the direct supervision of an embedded UX designer? What could we supply product owners so even they could contribute?</p></div>

  <div class="col-md-8 themed-grid-col">  <p> The high level request was a full theme refactor. Management was asking for an administrative tool that was a sharp contrast from our previous themes.  Pharmacy lighting and touch screen consoles were usually a factor.  In contrast these workflows would normally be conducted in an office setting under normal lighting conditions. Mobile responsiveness was a lower level request for the majority of users but it was necessary to account for it in planning. User feedback was necessary to determine to what degree of optimization mobile responsiveness would need to be. We established 3 general phases each with its own set of subsequent features.</p> </div>

    <span>1. Refactor Look and Feel. </span> The product lines were already established so a momentary pause was made to new features. Two scrum teams were assigned the initial reskin. As time was of the essence my initial role was to establish the new palettes and specifications for the general components of the existing UI. We also began exploring the need for a navigational restructure and dashboard concept.</p></div>

    <span>2. Collect and create reusable components. </span> We began compiling the detailed specifications into the new design system. I was embedded on the core team that created the new Storybook library.  The Agile product owner  and I met on a regular cadence updating and refining the backlog, accounting for all library assets. 
    I conducted design reviews daily to make sure specifications were being met.  In parallel, UX was working to solidify the restyling of the angular components and documenting them in Zeroheight. We used Brad Frost's Atomic Design methodology as an inspiration to establish our asset hierarchy.</p></div>

    <span> 3. Refinement. </span>The majority of the main structural components were implemented. buttons, text boxes, modals, tables, navigational patterns etc.   We were now delving into revisiting the refinement of any of these components to ensure we were continuing to meet business requirements.  It was decided not deviate from angular material unless absolutely necessary.</p></div>

  <div class="col-md-8 themed-grid-col">  <h2 class="mt-4">The Results</h2>   </div>
 
 
   <div class="col-md-8 themed-grid-col"> 
      <p>As the new theme was fully integrated, we were now free to revisit prior business needs.  I continued to be embedded within the scrum team that originally established the new library. Once  again we redirected our efforts to creating new features.  I continued to attend planning and grooming to assist in facilitating the ideation and introduction of these new workflows. I was also given a secondary scrum team that concentrated on a ubiquitous search feature. </p>

      <p>UX created wireframe and pixel comp starter pages and made them accessible to everyone to encourage ideation.
        We also conducted departmental brown bag forums to advocate for continued visibility of our new design system.  Weekly UX team design review meetings were continued to discuss proof of concepts relative to each of our embedded teams.  The purpose was to find parallel use cases amongst other designers and to solidify whether an item was unique or could also be used by teams.  We leaned towards only using components that could prove valuable in multiple use cases. The model proved successful and the design system was now in a stable place to continue refinements in addition to new workflows.
